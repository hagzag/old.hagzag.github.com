Yes I am a Hacker wannabe [Octopress slogen is "A blogging framewrok for hackers" ... ].

Now seriously, i've been down the road with many blog / CMS engines, [Drupal](http://ww.drupal.org), [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) and all I really wanted was 
a note-pad with no fancy WYSIWYG{% fn_ref 1 %} editor with a bazillion plug-ins which will enable me to embed images / videos or a simple syntax highlighter.

So I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which is just frekin' simple to use + it's cheap [hosting on Github Pages]

>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and youâ€™re set.

* Social links preloaded, Facebook, Twitter, disqus & other are built-in
* Syntax high-lighting built-in
* there are more good reasons [here](http://octopress.org/docs/) [and here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins)

The only problem was / is migrating all the stuff I have on-line so that is still a work in progress ...
->So I guess I'll have to see if this ones sticks!<-
