    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JBoss, Selenium, Maven, Hudson, <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/M2+Extra+Steps+Plugin">M2 Extra Steps</a> &amp; <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Files+Found+Trigger">Files Found Trigger</a> plugins - how do all these work together in a continuous build + Integration test life-cycle ?</p>

<p><strong>The Story - The Use Case</strong>:</p>

<p>We have two projects with two war artifacts which need to be deployed to a JBoss Application Server, whilst both webapps share a common base configuration, although the release life-cycle of each war have no correlation to the other.</p>

<p>In production both application servers are running &amp; serving one another thus, Integration test should cover both JBoss instances &amp; test their web services.</p>

<p>We are using selenium tests for both webapps and they need to run straight after a continuous build of each of the servers mentioned above. That said a change in project A or in project B should trigger the Integration tests job, whilst if either project A or project B are running the integration test plugin shouldn't run (at least until both projects / one of them is complete).</p>

<p><strong>The "work around" - forcing the "native Hudson" configuration</strong> (which we didn't go with naturally):</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Create a Job which builds Project A and Project B then as a downstream job will run ITest job. The problems with this method was -</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Project A and Project B do not have the same release life-cycle therefore, I would be forced to have a separate build process for their release / chain the release of these webapps.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> I would be building one of the projects for nothing (~ 10 minuets penalty) - if nothing changed in Project A / B why build the other for</p>

<p>nothing?</p>

<p>As a matter fo fact Project A doesn't change much, our consideration was - Project A will change once in two weeks whilst Project B will change on a daily basis - that is why we needed a smarter solution:</p>

<p><strong>A more Creative </strong><strong>Solution</strong>:</p>

<p><em>Step 1 - configure m2 "extra steps" post-build action for Project A &amp; B</em>:</p>

<p>Project A - build a.war, and as a post build task it would copy the a.war into a shared location. For example purposes lets call it <em><strong>/sharedfolder</strong></em>, in Project B we would do the same.</p>

<p>Upon a successful build of Project A and Project B we will result with <em><strong>/sharedfolder</strong></em> with a &amp; b war files in it. Let me point out these are two standard maven jobs which have the mvn clean install (or deploy) life-cycles and with <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/M2+Extra+Steps+Plugin">M2 extra steps plugin</a> you can run a shell / bash which will just copy a &amp; b wars to the <strong><em>/sharedfolder</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ExtraStepsPost.png" title="'Post M2 steps'" >
<em><strong>Please note</strong></em>: if running in distributed Hudson make <strong>/sharedfolder </strong>a location both the servers building a, b &amp; ITest Jobs can write to (NFS, SMB mount if you must).<strong><br/>
</strong></p>

<p><em>Step 2 - Add Files Found Trigger &amp; M2 Extra steps:</em></p>

<p>1. Manage Hudson >> Manage plugins.</p>

<p>2. Install the missing plugins (will be under the available tab if not installed already)</p>

<p>3. Reload / Restart Hudson</p>

<p>_Step 3 - create / configure ITest Job:<br/>
_</p>

<p>Create a freestyle (or maven depends on selenium configuration) job named <strong>Itest</strong> which has a <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Files+Found+Trigger">Files Found Trigger</a> (SCM should be configured to checkout the selenium test - may it be Maven / Ant or whatever executes it for you :), in the Files found configuration have <strong><em>/sharedfolder </em></strong><strong>and </strong> <em><strong>a.war, b.war</strong></em> (note the "," delimiter) watched for changes and configure the trigger to run every 5 / 10 minuets according to your preference - so the <strong>Files Found Trigger </strong>will test <em>/sharedfolder every $n minuets for changes in the filesystem and trigger a build accordingly.</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/FilesChangedTrigger_0.png" title="'Files Changed Trigger'" ></p>

<p>I thought I was finished but The only problem was if either Project A or Project B was running I didn't want ITest to run until the Upstream project (either Project a  or b completes) and the built in upstream / downstream doesn't support "wait for either Project A or Project B to complete".</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p><em>Step 4 - Add m2 "extra steps" pre-build action</em> <em>for Project A &amp; B</em>:</p>

<p>I went back to Project A and Project B configuration and added a pre build snippet which removed <strong><em>/sharedfolder/a.war for Project A and </em></strong><strong><em>/sharedfolder/b.war for Project B.<br/>
</em></strong>
<img src="/assets/images/ExtraStepsPrenPost.png" title="'re &amp; Post steps'" >
<em>**</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Now I have achieved - </em></strong><em>**</em>The Final result<em>**</em><strong><em>:</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>No parallel building of Project A,B or ITest</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>ITest will be triggered wither if a.war or b.war will change (that is where the Files Found Trigger comes in)</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong>I can still keep Project A &amp; Project B in their regular continuous life-cycle.</p>

<p>Also<strong>note</strong> <strong>that</strong>: The FS-SCM (<a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/File+System+SCM">File System SCM</a>) plugin (which seemed a good candidate at first) - will not work for you in this case, for on each change the Itest project will run. So even if Project A removed a.war this will be treated as a SCM change in the FS, and will trigger a new ITest build.</p>

<p>Hope you find this tip helpful.</p>
